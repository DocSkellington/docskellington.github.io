# This website

Apart from the [academic CV](academic/index.md), I also use this website to discuss various things, in [English](nonacademic/en/index.md) or in [French](nonacademic/fr/index.md), depending on the subject.
Typically, the English part contains programming-related pages, while the French one focuses more on some of my hobbies.
