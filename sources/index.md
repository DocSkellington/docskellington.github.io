# This website

Apart from the [academic CV](academic/index.md), I also use this website to discuss various things:

  - An [English part](nonacademic/en/index.md) that typically contains programming-related pages (or, rather, will when I will take the time),
  - A [French part](nonacademic/fr/index.md) that focuses on some of my hobbies.
