    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      Computer systems are ubiquitous nowadays and it goes without saying that their correctness is of
      capital importance in a lot of cases. However, identifying bugs and faults in computer systems is a
      hard and complex task. On top of well-known methods such as unit testing, integration testing, and
      so on, one can apply model checking techniques, which formally verify that a model (an abstract
      representation of the system) behaves correctly with regards to a set of constraints. Constructing
      a model from a system is itself complex and may introduce errors that do not occur in the actual
      system. Fortunately, if the system can be modeled by an automaton (a state machine describing which
      execution is valid or invalid), one can apply active automata learning algorithms to automatically
      construct an automaton by interacting with the computer system in a black-box manner, i.e., by
      only observing runs of the system without having access to its internal details. While the original
      algorithm introduced in 1987 by Dana Angluin focused on simple automata than can only use their
      states to determine whether an execution is valid or not, many efforts were made in recent years to
      learn more complex (and, thus, more expressive) families of automata that can use resources, such as
      a stack, registers, etc. In this thesis, we present two learning algorithms for two distinct extensions
      of automata (with different available resources), as well as a model checking approach for JSON
      documents, relying on automata learning. We divide our contributions into three axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firstly, we provide a learning algorithm for a family of automata extended with a natural counter,
      which can be incremented or decremented along the transitions. Furthermore, it can be tested
      against zero, allowing different behaviors based on the current counter value. Since the counter does
      not have an upper bound in general, the number of pairs of a state and a counter value is potentially
      infinite, meaning that learning the behavior of a system requires special care. We provide a finite
      characterization of this behavior that can be learned by querying the system, and from which a
      one-counter automata can be extracted. We show that the algorithm builds a polynomial number of
      hypotheses in the size of this characterization but requires exponentially many interactions to do
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, we focus on JSON documents, which can be used to store and transfer information in
      a way that is easily readable by a human and by a computer. More precisely, we assume that we
      are in a streaming context, i.e., the document is received piece by piece (which happens when a
      document is sent via a network, for instance), and that we want to verify whether the document is
      valid with regards to a set of constraints, given as a JSON schema. The classical algorithm exploring
      the constraints and the document in parallel requires to keep the full document in memory in the
      worst case and, thus, is not always appropriate in a streaming scenario. Our new approach first
      learns an automaton augmented with a stack that is then abstracted and used to efficiently decide
      whether a document is valid, without needing to store the whole document. That is, our validation
      algorithm has a lower overall memory requirement, at the cost of needing more time to validate a
      document, as observed on experimental results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we study automata whose resources are timers that can be used to encode timing constraints.
      A timer is started at some value and decreases over time. Then, when it reaches zero, a special event
      occurs that must be handled, similarly to interruptions in a processor. It may happen that multiple
      timers reach zero at the same time, or that the user provides an input exactly at the same time a timer
      times out. In these cases, the model has a non-deterministic behavior as the automaton may decide
      to process these events in any order. We study the timed behavior of such an automaton and provide
      conditions ensuring that any untimed behavior can be observed without this non-determinism.
      Finally, we give an active learning algorithm, requiring a factorial number of interactions in the
      number of timers, and polynomial in the number of states. As, in practice, the number of timers
      remains relatively small, we claim that our algorithm can be used for real-world applications.
