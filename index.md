title: GaÃ«tan Staquet's website
---

This site is split into two distinctive parts: [one in English](generated/en/index.md), and [one in French](generated/fr/index.md).
Both treat completely different subjects.
If you are fluent enough to understand both languages, please take a look at all the contents.

This website is far from finished and is definitely not my priority.
Its content will grow over time but I do not guarantee any timeline.

This website is built using Pandoc.
If you are interested in the technical details, you can consult [the repository](https://github.com/DocSkellington/docskellington.github.io).
